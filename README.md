#CHESS ANALYSIS


##Introduction


This project will analyze my Chess.com game data to gain a deeper understanding of my playing habits and performance trends, specifically focusing on rapid games. The dataset includes comprehensive information about my games, such as results, accuracy, timing, and tactical patterns. By thoroughly exploring this data, I aim to uncover insights into my strengths and weaknesses, identify patterns in my gameplay, and understand how different factors affect my performance. This analysis will help me reflect on my playing style and find areas for improvement to become a more effective chess player.


##Dataset


The dataset provides detailed information about my rapid games on Chess.com and includes the following key aspects:
==> Games Played and Accuracy: The dataset tracks the total number of games Iâ€™ve played, along with their outcomes (wins, losses, and draws). It also highlights trends in my average accuracy and how it varies depending on whether I win, lose, or draw.

==> Game Results and Opponent Ratings: This section categorizes how my games ended, such as through resignation, timeout, abandonment, or checkmate. It also includes an analysis of my performance against opponents with different skill levels, offering insights into how I fare against stronger or weaker players.

==> Game Shapes and Phases: Explores game shapes like "balanced" or "wild," as well as performance during different phases (opening, middlegame, endgame).

==> Openings Performance: Evaluates my most-used openings, highlighting strengths and weaknesses.

==> Move Quality: Analyzes move types, such as "brilliant," "blunder," or "missed wins," and tracks these over time.

==> Tactical Patterns: Reviews found vs. missed tactical opportunities like forks, pins, and mates.

==> Castling Patterns: Studies my castling behavior and its impact on results.

==> Geographic Data: Maps the locations of my opponents to show the diversity of my competition.

##Project Idea
The primary goal of this project is to use my Chess.com game data to gain insights into my playing style and habits. By analyzing various aspects of my games, such as performance in different phases, move quality, and openings, I aim to identify areas where I can improve. Ultimately, the analysis will help me refine my strategies and develop a more consistent and effective approach to playing chess.
