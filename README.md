# CHESS ANALYSIS

## Introduction

This project analyzes my Chess.com game data to better understand my playing habits and performance trends, with a specific focus on rapid games. The dataset, which I will use Chess.comâ€™s public API, provides insights into my games, including results, accuracy, timing, and other key metrics. By using the API, I will retrieve  game information, such as move history, player ratings, and game outcomes.

By exploring this dataset, I aim to uncover my playing style, identify my strengths and weaknesses, and understand how various factors, such as accuracy and move timing, influence my performance. This project will help me evaluate my decision-making in different game scenarios, analyze how I perform against opponents of various skill levels, and assess my effectiveness with specific openings and strategies. Ultimately, my goal is to reflect on these insights to refine my playing style, improve my gameplay consistency, and develop a more effective chess strategy.

## Motivation

While thinking about a project, I wanted to learn how to collect, organize, and analyze data from a real-world source. Since I enjoy playing chess, I decided to use my own game data from Chess.com as the focus. The motivation for this project is to better understand how to work with APIs, process data, and represent it in a meaningful way. By analyzing my game results, accuracy, and playing habits, I also aim to improve my skills both in data handling and chess strategy.

## Dataset

The dataset contains detailed information about my Chess.com rapid games and includes the following key aspects such as:

 **Games Played and Accuracy**  
   - Tracks the total number of games played, along with outcomes (wins, losses, draws).  
   - Analyzes my accuracy and examines how it changes depending on the game result.
**Game Results and Opponent Ratings**  
   - Categorizes how games ended, such as through resignation, timeout, abandonment, or checkmate.  
   - Provides an analysis of my performance against opponents of varying skill levels, highlighting how I fare against stronger or weaker players.

**Win/Loss Ratio by Color**  
   - Analyzes how my performance differs when playing as White versus Black.  
   - Identifies if I have a stronger win rate with one color.

**Average Time Spent Per Move**  
   - Calculates the average time spent per move for each game.

**Move Analysis**  
   - Calculates the average number of moves in my games.  

**Openings Performance**  
   - Evaluates the effectiveness of my most-used openings.  
   - Highlights which openings are most successful for me and where I might need improvement.

**Geographic Data**  
   - Maps the locations of my opponents to visualize the diversity of players I face.

## Project Idea

The primary goal of this project is to analyze my Chess.com game data to gain meaningful insights into my playing style, habits, and performance trends. By leveraging the Chess.com public API, I have collected detailed data about my games, including accuracy scores, move timings, results, and opponent information. This project aims to identify areas where I excel and areas that need improvement, such as specific openings and time management. Through this analysis, I hope to refine my strategies, understand my decision-making  and develop a more consistent and effective approach to playing chess.

This project is not only a personal improvement tool but also serves as a demonstration of how data can be used to uncover patterns and improve performance in a structured way. The insights generated can act as a guide to help me track my progress over time and implement actionable improvements in my gameplay.


## Plan

1. **Data Collection**
   - Get my rapid game data using the Chess.com public API.
   - Organize the data and make sure it includes important details like accuracy, results, moves, and opponent ratings.

2. **Data Analysis**
   - Explore key performance metrics like accuracy trends, win/loss ratios, and time spent per move.
   - Analyze my success rates with different openings and evaluate performance as White and Black.
   - Categorize games based on termination type (resignation, timeout, checkmate) and game length (short vs. long games).
   - Study opponent diversity by mapping player locations.

3. **Visualization**
   - Create clear and engaging graphs and charts to illustrate insights, such as accuracy over time, win/loss ratios, and game lengths.

4. **Documentation**
   - Write down the methods, results, and improvements based on the analysis.
   - Share everything in a clear format, like a GitHub repository.
